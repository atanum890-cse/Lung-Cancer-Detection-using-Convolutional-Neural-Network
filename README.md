# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically detect lung cancer from CT scan images. The model learns image features to classify cancerous and non-cancerous cases, enhancing early diagnosis accuracy and supporting radiologists in efficient medical decision-making.
