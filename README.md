# Lung-Cancer-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically detect lung cancer from CT scan images. The model learns image features to classify cancerous and non-cancerous cases, enhancing early diagnosis accuracy and supporting radiologists in efficient medical decision-making.
Things I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into:

Data preprocessing techniques for handling missing values.
Feature selection and its impact on model performance.
Implementing various machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.
Evaluating model performance using different metrics.
Visualizing data and model results for better understanding.
